Working in the search technology space in the early 2010s, it was impossible to miss the meteoric rise of Elasticsearch.

At the time, most search engines were expensive and closed-source. Getting them up and running took hours of editing configuration files. Elasticsearch changed all that. It was free and open source, and all it took to get started was unzip a file, start an executable, and throw some data at it. It's hard to understate how magical the Elasticsearch getting started experience was.

In 2012, the team behind Elasticsearch founded a company, Elastic. I remember thinking: "if I ever get the chance to work for them, I'll jump right on it." That opportunity presented itself a few years later. In 2016, I joined Elastic's Education team as a technical instructor. That's when I really fell in love with Elasticsearch. Its ease of use and elegant API harnessed a powerful Swiss army knife for data.

Fifteen years since its first release, Elasticsearch is more relevant than ever. Beyond search, it has evolved into a flexible data platform, with applications in for example [DevSecOps](https://link.es24h.com/3846). More recently, with the advent of AI, Elasticsearch has become an excellent platform for [retrieval-augmented generation](https://link.es24h.com/e2de) and [semantic search](https://link.es24h.com/cf54).

The breadth and depth of Elasticsearch can make getting started a daunting task for newcomers. In the early years of Elasticsearch, a great book that would help you get started was [Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide](https://link.es24h.com/9246). However, ten years after its publishing date, it has become outdated.

An up-to-date resource to help you get started with Elasticsearch does currently not exist. That got me thinking: with almost 10 years of experience teaching Elasticsearch, maybe that's something I could create. 

In the coming months, I want to develop a modern guide that helps you get started with Elasticsearch in 24 hours. From running Elasticsearch for the first time, to ingesting data and writing queries, and more advanced topics like scripting and working with large language models.

Join me here at [es24h.com](https://es24h.com/), as I develop this content in the coming months.
